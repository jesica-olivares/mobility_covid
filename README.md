#  Mobility and COVID-19

We visualize the relation of the COVID (new cases) and six mobility indices of Retail and recreation, Supermarket and pharmacy, Parks, Public transport, Workplaces, Residential. Then we classify the results in two phases of with and without vaccination and review the changes in the dynamics of the relation. 

### Data Sources
Google COVID19 Mobility Data: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ 
<br>Our Word in Data Website: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-stringency-index 

### Descriptive analysis
We visualize the effect of covid into mobility data, taking into consideration, public policies such as stay at home requirements and stringency index

### Modeling
We try to understand the effect of mobility into new COVID cases, modeling the latest based on mobility factors, considering a time lapse between the mobility data and the COVID cases in order to find the time lapse that maximize the performance of the model
